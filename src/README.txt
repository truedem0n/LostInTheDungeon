How our level editor works:
- Insert shows a menu on screen to insert an entity
- When an entity is being dragged, you can press 'm' to change its animation through the onscreen menu
- The onscreen menu is controlled using the arrow keys and pressing enter to make a selection
- Press 'F1' to start inputting a file name which will appear on screen
- Press enter to save to that filename
- We have included out shaders in the src folder, but our engine looks for them in the bin
- We have also included assets.txt in the src folder as we modified it for the adding entities menu
- The changes to assets.txt are adding a group name for a group of animations and adding a boolean for the animation that represents the group
